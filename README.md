SMSSync-JServer
===============

Complete server implementation in JEE for SMSSync gateway application.
As a service/microservices dev i found the project SMSSYnc http://smssync.ushahidi.com/ very interresting to prototype some app with SMS feature enabled. 

I wrote a Java implementation, server side of this great applicaton.
All the current features (On 10 May 2014) available on the gateway app are implemented in SMSSyn-JServer
SMSSync-JServer can:
-receive SMSs from the android gateway app
-validate secret during the exchanges
-send SMS back as direct answer from server to gateway as the SMS is received
-send SMSs back using the batch feature available in SMSSync gateway app


Feel free to:
-use
-fork
-copy
-modify
