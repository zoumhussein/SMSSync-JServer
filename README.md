SMSSync-JServer
===============

<p>
Complete server implementation in JEE for SMSSync gateway application.
As a service/microservices dev i found the project SMSSYnc http://smssync.ushahidi.com/ very interresting to prototype some app with SMS feature enabled.
</p>

<p>
I wrote a Java implementation, server side of this great applicaton.
All the current features (On 10 May 2014) available on the gateway app are implemented in SMSSyn-JServer
</p>
<p>
SMSSync-JServer can: <br>
-receive SMSs from the android gateway app<br>
-validate secret during the exchanges<br>
-send SMS back as direct answer from server to gateway as the SMS is received<br>
-send SMSs back using the batch feature available in SMSSync gateway app<br>
</p>
<p>
Feel free to: <br>
-use<br>
-fork<br>
-copy<br>
-modify<br>
</p>
without any restrictions
