SMSSync-JServer
===============

<p>
Complete server implementation in JEE for SMSSync gateway application.
As a service/microservices dev i found the project SMSSYnc http://smssync.ushahidi.com/ very interresting to prototype some app with SMS feature enabled.
</p>

<p>
I wrote a Java implementation, server side of this great applicaton.
All the current features (On 10 May 2014) available on the gateway app are implemented in SMSSyn-JServer
</p>
<p>
SMSSync-JServer can: <br>
<li>receive SMSs from the android gateway app</li>
<li>validate secret during the exchanges</li>
<li>send SMS back as direct answer from server to gateway as the SMS is received</li>
<li>send SMSs back using the batch feature available in SMSSync gateway app</li>
</p>
<p>
Feel free to:
<li>use</li>
<li>fork</li>
<li>copy</li>
<li>modify</li>
</p>
without any restrictions
